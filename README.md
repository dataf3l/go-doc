# go-doc
This tool is intended to generate docs from golang code.
I found godoc to be difficult to use, so I decided to write my
own documentation generator.
I hope you find it useful.

## usage:

go-doc /your-source-code-folder /destination-docs-folder

## Dependencies

Just use the current version of go to compile the program.

### Maybe you don't have golang installed?

If you can't compile go programs, why would you need a doc tool?

### License

This code is public domain.
